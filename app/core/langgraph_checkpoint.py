"""
Resume logic for the two LangGraph-natively-checkpointed stages (Image
Generation, Video Generation) - kept separate from checkpoint.py's flat
JSON mechanism rather than folded into it, since they solve different
problems: checkpoint.py answers "did this whole stage already finish,"
while this answers "did this stage finish, get partway through, or never
start" - a three-way distinction JSON-per-finished-stage can't make, which
is exactly why these two stages get LangGraph's own checkpointer instead.

Both agents share this because both share the same graph shape (start ->
generate -> validate -> bump_retry/advance_theme -> finalize, looping over
a variable number of themes) - the resume decision is identical for both,
just parameterized by which state key finalize_node sets.

    Runs `graph` (already compiled with a checkpointer) under `config`
    (must carry a thread_id), handling all three states a thread can be in:

    - Never run before: `snapshot.values` is empty and `snapshot.next` is
      empty too - invoke with the real input, same as an uncheckpointed run.
    - Partway through (a prior attempt crashed mid-theme-loop):
      `snapshot.next` is non-empty (there's a pending node to resume at) -
      invoke with None, which continues from the last completed node rather
      than re-applying fresh_input on top of already-progressed state.
    - Already finished: `output_key` is present and non-None in
      `snapshot.values` - don't invoke at all, just return the existing
      state. This is what lets LangGraph's own checkpointer also cover the
      "skip a whole finished stage" case the JSON checkpoint provides for
      the other stages, without needing a second mechanism layered on top.

    output_key is checked before `snapshot.next`, not after: both "never
    started" and "finished" look like an empty `.next` tuple on their own,
    so the two can only be told apart by whether the stage's own output
    field was ever populated.

    Returns a dict shaped like graph.ainvoke's return either way, so
    callers can do result[output_key] regardless of which branch ran.

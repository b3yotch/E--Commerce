"""
Output contract for the Video Generation Agent (Agent 6).

Mirrors Agent 4's schema.py shape deliberately (GeneratedVideo /
ThemeVideoResult / VideoGenerationOutput <-> GeneratedImage /
ThemeGenerationResult / ImageGenerationOutput) rather than inventing a
different structure - same reasoning either way: one wrapper per theme,
the wrapper carries provenance + timing + retry count, the leaf object
carries the actual generated-file details.

Two real differences from Agent 4's shape, not oversights:

1. No list[GeneratedVideo] per theme - Agent 4 keeps every candidate in a
   batch because Agent 5 (Image Selection) picks a winner from that batch
   before this agent ever runs; by the time Agent 6 sees a theme, there is
   already exactly one chosen source frame. Video generation itself also
   deliberately produces exactly one video per theme (see
   Video_generation.md Challenge 2 discussion - video's cost profile
   doesn't reward batching the way cheap image batches did), so `video` is
   a single optional field, not a list.
2. `status` distinguishes "skipped_no_source_image" from "success" -
   Agent 4 has no equivalent because it always has *something* to attempt
   (a prompt). This agent can hit a theme with no valid source frame to
   animate (that theme was itself skipped upstream - either Agent 4
   exhausted its own retries, or Agent 5 had nothing valid left to select
   from after its own deterministic filter - see Image_generation.md
   Challenge 3 and Image_selection.md) - that's not a generation failure
   worth retrying, so it's recorded explicitly rather than silently
   absent. A genuine retries-exhausted generation failure, by contrast, is
   NOT recorded here at all - same as Agent 4, the theme is simply absent
   from theme_results.

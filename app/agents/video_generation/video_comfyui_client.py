"""
ComfyUI client for the Video Generation Agent (Agent 5).

Subclasses Agent 4's ComfyUIClient rather than duplicating or modifying it,
to reuse queue_prompt/fetch_image_bytes/check_checkpoint as-is - those are
generic to ComfyUI's HTTP API, not specific to image generation. Two
things are added deliberately as an override + new methods, not as edits
to Agent 4's file, so its already-tested code stays untouched:

1. wait_for_completion is overridden here, not patched in the base class.
   The base version (correctly, for images) checks each node's output for
   an "images" key. The video workflow's save node's output key isn't
   "images" and isn't a stable name across custom node packages -
   confirmed during hand-testing, not assumed - so this override accepts
   any non-empty outputs dict instead of a specific key, same as the
   hand-test script that was proven working before this became agent
   code.
2. upload_image, load_video_workflow_template, build_video_workflow, and
   extract_video_outputs are new. Agent 4 never needed an image-upload
   path (text-to-image has no image input), and the video workflow graph
   is structurally nothing like build_image_workflow's core-node graph -
   it's an externally-authored, custom-node-based workflow this project
   doesn't construct from scratch, only patches specific node IDs inside
   (see Settings' comfyui_video_*_node_id fields for what those IDs are
   pinned to and what breaks the pinning).

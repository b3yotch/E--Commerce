"""
State for the Video Generation subgraph (Agent 6).

Mirrors ImageGenerationState's shape and naming closely. Three things worth
calling out:

1. This agent takes TWO upstream inputs, not one - `prompts` (Agent 3's
   PromptGenerationOutput, for video_prompt/motion_description per theme)
   AND `selection` (Agent 5's ImageSelectionOutput, for the already-chosen
   source frame per theme). This is NOT Agent 4's raw ImageGenerationOutput
   - the whole point of Agent 5 existing is that this agent shouldn't have
   to pick a candidate itself anymore. Agents 1-4 each only ever consumed
   the single immediately-prior agent's output; this is the first agent in
   the chain that needs two, and its second input comes from Agent 5, not
   Agent 4 directly, now that Agent 5 sits between them.
2. `_pending_result` is declared here on purpose - see Image_generation.md
   Challenge 7. That bug (a returned-but-undeclared state key silently
   dropped by LangGraph, making validation always fail despite generation
   succeeding every time) is exactly the kind of mistake worth guarding
   against explicitly when porting a pattern to a new agent, not just
   trusting muscle memory to remember it this time.
3. The upstream-images field was renamed from `images: ImageGenerationOutput`
   to `selection: ImageSelectionOutput` - not just a rename, the type
   changed too. Left as `images` of the old type, a stale read like
   `theme_result.images[0]` would still type-check against the wrong
   schema and fail silently at runtime instead of being caught up front.
   Renaming forces every read site in nodes.py to be touched deliberately.

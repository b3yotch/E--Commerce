"""
Output contract for the Creative Strategy Agent.

Field shapes here aren't guessed upfront - they're informed by the 3-way
model comparison run before implementation (Scout / Llama 3.3 70B /
gpt-oss-120b against the same sample ProductResearch inputs). All three
models, unprompted, naturally separated audience angles into
segment/angle/rationale and visual themes into setting/mood/palette - so
those became structured sub-models rather than free text, the same reasoning
Agent 1 used for its explicit ProductResearch fields over a free-text blob.

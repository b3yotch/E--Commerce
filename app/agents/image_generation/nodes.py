"""
Node functions for the Image Generation Agent.

Retry loop mirrors Agents 1-3's shape (generate -> validate -> bump_retry ->
generate) per your call to keep auto-retry despite no persistence existing
yet. One deliberate addition: each retry draws a NEW random seed rather than
reusing the same one.

Why: with a deterministic sampler, same seed + same prompt + same params
will reproduce the exact same output - including the exact same failure if
the failure was ComfyUI erroring on that specific generation (not a
transient network blip). Retrying with a fresh seed means a retry can
actually succeed differently; retrying with the same seed only helps for
failures that are pure infrastructure flakiness (timeout, connection reset),
and silently wastes a retry attempt on anything else. This is a real
decision, not an oversight - flagging it here the same way Agent 3 flagged
its model-choice decisions, in case you want same-seed retries instead for
a specific transient-failure debugging scenario.

State keys (prompts/retries/error/images) match the naming pattern
test_full_pipeline_live.py already uses for Agents 1-3 (research -> creative
-> prompts), so this agent slots into the same script without inventing a
different vocabulary.
